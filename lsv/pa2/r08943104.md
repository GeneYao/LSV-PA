## Implmentation
### Some Details
* Implement by base-line implementation provide form lecture
* Use hash table to extract the mapping of the Name and ID from original `Abc_Ntk_t`
* Use vetor\<int\> to store the Id of PI od unateness
* Store the unateness PI with `Id` of `Abc_Ntk_t`
* Sort it with increasing order of `Id` and use hash table to turn it back to Name of `Abc_Ntk_t`
* Traverse through the PI of `Abc_Ntk_t` and compare to CI of `Aig_Man_t` set the unuse PI to +unate and -unate

### Obtain an AIG circuit
* Iterate each PO by `Abc_NtkForEachPo(pNtk, pPo, i)`
* Extract Cone from `Abc_Ntk_t` by `Abc_NtkCreateCone`
* Turn `Abc_Ntk_t` to `Aig_Man_t` by `Abc_NtkToDar()`

### Derive a CNF formula
* Drervie `Cnf_Dat_t` from `Aig_Man_t` by `Cnf_Derive()`

### Manipulate a CNF formula
* Duplicate another `Cnf_Dat_t` from origin cnf for negetive cofactor by `Cnf_DataDup()`
* Use `Cnf_DataLift()` incriment the variable by the specified number of negative cofactor's circuit

### Initialize an SAT solver
* Init sat solver by `Cnf_DataWriteIntoSolver()` with  cnf of positive cofactor's circuit
* Use `sat_solver_addclause()` to add clause with negative cofactor's circuit

### manipulate an SAT solver
* Use `sat_solver_addvar()` to add control variable of each PI
* Use `sat_solver_add_buffer_enable()` to adds cluase between two variables controlled by an enabling variable
* Use a `lit` array with size of PI nums + 4 to deal with the incremental learning
* `assumption[PI_nums+4]`: Besdies PI_nums od assumtion,  two variable is control the complement of the PI (cofactor) and two variable is control output for positive unate or negative unate.

## CNF Formula
$PO:\{f,g\}$, f is cone of positve part, f is cone of negative part
$PI:\{x_1,...x_n,y_1,...,y_n\}$, $x_i$ is cone of positve part, $y_i$ is cone of negative part
$\text{control variable: } \{\alpha_1,....,\alpha_n\}$

Add clause: 
* Control PI:
$(\neg \alpha_i \lor x_i \lor \neg y_i) \land (\neg \alpha_i \lor \neg x_i \lor y_i)$, for $1<i<n$

* Control PO:
$f_x \land \neg g_{\neg x}$


## Discussion
- Can your implementation solve the remaining 7 test cases (possibly with a longer time limit)?
Yes, but the and nodes of hyp.aig is about five time of mem_ctrl.aig it can not run within time limits. Other design can run within time limits (300s) from my program.

- How does your implementation compared to the BDD- based command `print_unate` in ABC?
Compare them with `mem_ctrl.aig`:

`lsv_print_pounate`: 91s

`print_unate`: 12s

It seems like BDD is suitable for unate finding. Or there is a a lot od things need to improve in my program. 

- What are the differences between random control and arithmetic circuits? Which category is more challenging?
As we can see from the number of and node in each benchmark the total number of **Arithmetic circuits** is much more larger than  **Random/Control Benchmarks**. There will imply much more cluase for Cnf and increase runtime largerly from SAT solver.

1. Arithmetic circuits:
Obtained by a simple-minded (automated) mapping of arithmetic computational algorithms into basic logic gates. 
Total and nodes: 373958

2. Random/Control Benchmarks
Consists of various types of controllers, arbiters, routers, converters, decoders, voters and random functions. 
Total and nodes: 76441
